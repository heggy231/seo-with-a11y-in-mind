							<p>Outside the front door of 
							<a href="#">Willow Farm</a> is a broad 
							curving gravel drive, at the far end of which a 
							white gate opens into the lane. On one side of this 
							drive is a narrow strip of ground planted with 
							flowers and shrubs, and close to the front door 
							there is a patch of grass on which stands a large 
							old mulberry tree.</p>
							<p>On the other side of the drive 
							is a lawn. Beyond that are more flowers and then the 
							vegetable garden; further on still is a little wood 
							or coppice of nut bushes. On this March morning we 
							shall find some wild flowers in this little wood.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 1.6em;">Heading 2</p>
							<p>Between the vegetable garden and the wood is a low 
							grassy bank. It is bright to-day with yellow 
							primroses. The Primrose always blossoms early here, 
							for the bank is sunny and is sheltered from cold 
							winds.</p>
							<p>I daresay most of you have seen a Primrose 
							before to-day. Each pale yellow blossom is made up 
							of five petals, which are joined together forming a 
							tube or corolla. The petals are notched or
							indented on the outer edge. At the centre of the 
							blossom, where the petals meet, each petal is marked 
							with a spot of darker yellow. Each flower grows 
							alone on a long slender stem. At the top of the stem 
							is a kind of green tube out of which the yellow 
							blossom appears. The Primrose blossoms have a scent; 
							not strong, but very sweet and pleasant.</p>
							<p style="font-size: 1.2em; text-transform: uppercase;">Heading 3</p>
							<p>The leaves are called “radical” or “root” leaves. They 
							are so called because each leaf appears to grow 
							direct from the root. But the leaves really grow 
							from a short stem at the top of the root – a stem so 
							short that it does not appear above the ground at 
							all.</p>
							<p>Among the bushes of the coppice itself we 
							will notice the flowers which first catch our eye – 
							the pretty blossoms of the Wood Anemone. The whole 
							coppice is starred with the beautiful white flowers. 
							We pick one and see that it has six – six what? “Six 
							petals,” you say. No, these are not petals, for the 
							Anemone has none. They are sepals. The sepals of a 
							plant generally enclose the blossom before it is 
							opened, and they are usually green. In the Anemone 
							the petals are absent; the sepals take their place 
							and are white instead of green. Their under side is 
							often not pure white, but is streaked with pale 
							pink.</p>

						<p>At the further side of the coppice, where a hedge 
						separates it from the little meadow called Home Close, 
						are Sweet Violets. We catch their fragrant scent before 
						we see them, for the tiny flowers are half hidden among 
						broad green leaves. Each blossom has five petals of a 
						dark purple colour; there are white Sweet Violets too, 
						but none are growing in our little wood to-day.</p>
						<p>At the base of the blossom – the part where it joins the 
						stem – one of the petals has a little spur which points 
						back towards the stem. The blossom is therefore said to 
						be spurred; we may presently see other plants with 
						spurred flowers.</p>
						<p>There is another violet which grows wild in England – the Dog Violet. It is larger than our 
						Sweet Violets here, but it has no scent.</p>
						<p>While we have been examining the flowers on the ground, the nut 
						bushes above our heads are waiting to remind us of what 
						we said just now – that trees also have flowers. The 
						flowers of the nut bush or hazel are easily seen, for 
						they appear before the leaves are open. What we see 
						to-day are often called catkins, but the name which 
						country children give them is lambs’-tails. It is a very 
						good name, too, for they are more like the tail of some 
						tiny lamb than anything else.</p>
